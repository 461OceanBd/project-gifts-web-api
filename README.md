# project-gifts-web-api

## Description

This is an API project that is consumed by the mobile application named Gifts.
It is a spring boot application which uses Hibernate and JPA and a PostgreSQL database.

## Installation

- To start the project It's necessary to install PostgreSQL in the correct configuration version of your machine.
- Then you have to create the database locally :
	Open the SQL shell (psql) and hit enter until you reach "postgres = #".
	Here type the command "create database gifts;" to create the database.

- Paul came up with the idea for this project. He suggested that we work together. So, I realize the Rest API for the application which will migrate from a local database to this rest api.
